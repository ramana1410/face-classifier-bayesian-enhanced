# Face Classifier - Bayesian Enhanced

This project is an enhanced version of a face classification system using Bayesian techniques.

## 🔍 Description

The goal of this project is to classify facial images using a Naïve Bayes algorithm, improved with additional preprocessing and data handling techniques.

## 📁 Features

- Face detection using OpenCV
- Feature extraction using HOG
- Classification using Gaussian Naïve Bayes
- Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramana1410/face-classifier-bayesian-enhanced.git
